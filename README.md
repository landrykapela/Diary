# Diary

Diary is an application developed as part of the course assignment in the ALCWithGoogle 3.0 (ALC Google Africa Scholarship Challenge).
The app let's the user signin with a google account or a registered email/password combination. After successful login, the user can 
write down their thoughts. These are stored in a local database and the user can upload to a remote firebase realtime database for backup.
The app also allows the user to specify their mood as they write down their thoughts, which is also expressed with mood images.
